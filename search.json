    "text": "Welcome to the International Society for Kaigo Reseach Website.\nThe term kaigo (介護) is of Japanese origin and refers to caregiving, particularly for older adults and individuals with disabilities. Rooted in the values of respect and dignity, kaigo emphasises the importance of maintaining each person’s independence and autonomy, regardless of their care needs.\nMore than just a method of care, kaigo reflects a broader philosophy. It serves as a practical approach to implementing the principle of normalisation–the idea that all individuals, regardless of ability or age, should be supported to live as full and integrated members of society.\nAt its core, kaigo is person-centred. It is not limited to institutional or home-based care, but extends throughout the community. Whether in hospitals, care facilities, local neighbourhoods, or public spaces, kaigo fosters environments that support holistic, inclusive, and compassionate care."
